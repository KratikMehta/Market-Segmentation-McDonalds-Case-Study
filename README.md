The dataset used in this analysis is stored in a CSV file named `mcdonalds.csv`. The dataset contains information about customer perceptions of McDonald's, including variables related to taste, convenience, price, and more.

## Analysis Steps

1. Exploring Data: Read the dataset, convert segmentation variables to numeric values, and inspect the average values of transformed segmentation variables.

2. Extracting Segments: Use k-means clustering, mixtures of distributions and mixtures of regression models to identify segments and evaluate model selection criteria.

3. Profiling Segments: Analyze and visualize the segment profiles, including segment averages and separation.

4. Describing Segments: Further analyze and visualize the segments, including mosaic plots, boxplots, and decision tree classification.
